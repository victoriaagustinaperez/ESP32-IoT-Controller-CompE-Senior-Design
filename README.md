## Overview
### Description
(Senior Design II project) An Android mobile app that enables user to monitor the sensors (temperature, pH, moisture) and control the actuators (grow lights, fans, water pump) of an ESP32 LoRaWAN-enabled semi-autonomous greenhouse.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** IoT
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices.
- **Story:** Monitor the sensors (temperature, pH, moisture) and control the actuators (grow lights, fans, water pump) of an ESP32 LoRaWAN-enabled semi-autonomous greenhouse over the MQTT communication protocol.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app to control their smart greenhouse.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted to monitor and/or control their greenhouses' conditions.
- **Scope:** Instructions on how to download the app and pair it to a smart greenhouse would come include with any unit sold.
